As a user,

When I open the application...
01- I am presented with a title and header
02- A search-bar feature to search for various cities and their weather
03- A section displaying "today's" current weather and prompts
04- A section highlighting the forecast for the next five days
05- A footer section

01- Title/Search bar
-Need and input field for the user
-Need a search button to query the users search
-Event Listener/Keydown feature for the search bar to render the user's selected city

03- Current Weather Section
-Here, I need to display the rendered city and current weather/conditions to the user
    -Use fetch to and the weather API to display user's city and weather data.
-Display an image of the current weather to the user.

04- Five-Day Forecast
-Have some cards that display the weather data for the next five days in the selected city
    -Again, use fetch to get, store, and display the user's selected data
-Display the "weather image" for each of the five-days to the user.
