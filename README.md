# weather-tracker

## Objective

For this challenge, we were tasked with designing an application that is able to present weather for a user's desired city using information and dat from a third party API.

## How I Achieved This

I began this assignment drafting some psuedo code that was essential to helping me map out what I needed to accomplish during this challenge, as well as, some of the steps to take to get there. I used some "card" formatting from bootstrap to help design the "five-day forecast" section on the html side. The rest of the layout was made using bootstrap classes to format, but the sections were created manually. The main chunck of this assignment took place within the Javascript file. I used some Moment.js functions to design the current date and five, future dates layout. Then, I spent a lot of time working on "fetching" the data I needed for this assignment from openweathermap.org. I spent a ton of my time sifting through the data that I was trying to store in localStorage, and then displaying that to the user in the format I wanted. My tutor and I worked at establishing a "for of" loop, but I couldn't quite figure out the functionality of it, so I ended up typing a lot of redundant code, so I hope to go back and make it more concise in the coming days. Overall, the app seems to function as I intended and I am pretty happy with the current result.

## How This Applies To My Career

This challenge seemed very daunting at first and it truly pushed me and probably will continue to the more that I add to it. I applied a lot of new concepts throughout this challenge, but the main one that stuck with me was the "fetching" function and using and retrieving the data from third-party APIs. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and abilities with APIs and their data. This assignment kind of tied in with our Project 1 because we have been using APIs... mainly Spotify and SeatGeek, but combing through the lists of APIs availible out there really shows how vast this side of the industry is and I am excited to continue to dig deeper.
